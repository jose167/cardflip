                                    Having a Terms and Conditions agreement is completely optional. No laws require you to have one.

                                    It’s up to you to set the rules and guidelines that the user must agree to. You can think 
                                    of your Terms and Conditions agreement as the legal agreement where you maintain your rights 
                                    to exclude users from your app in the event that they abuse your app, where you maintain your
                                    legal rights against potential app abusers, and so on.
